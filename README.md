# Python I Final Group Project

### About this project
I completed this project in December 2023 in collaboration with 5 other students as our final project for our Master's-level Python I class. This project had two chapters. In the first chapter, the general prompts were the following:
Part 1: Complete some transformations over the Customers dataset and upload the resulting DataFrame in CSV format. 
Part 2: Perform a basic exploratory data analysis over the Customers dataset and answer some questions.
In the second chapter, the prompt was as follows: Present at least 5 insights about the Churn dataset, containing information about the customers of a telecommunications company.

### Technologies 
This project is coded in Python. Libraries used include: 🐼pandas | 🧮numpy | 📈matplotlib | 📉plotly | 🌊seaborn

### Challenges
While I have code reviewed others' SQL script before in a professional setting, at the time of this project I had never code reviewed Python before. This was a challenge, as I had to attempt to understand code in a language I had less experience in, in a situation where we each did additional research on syntax we did not learn in class in order to create better code.
Additionally, this project required a specific order of coding within each of the two parts, so my team had to plan who would do what when very carefully. We succeeded with this challenge and received a 100/100 on the project; I received Honors distinction in this course.
